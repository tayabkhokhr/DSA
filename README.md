# DSA
Solutions and implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
A well-organized collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** implemented in **C++**.  
##  Folder Structure
Each directory contains related problems and their implementations.

| Folder             | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Arrays/`          | Basic operations, sorting, searching problems |
| `LinkedList/`      | Singly, Doubly, Circular lists                 |
| `Stack/`           | Stack using arrays and linked lists           |
| `Queue/`           | Queue, Circular Queue, Deque implementations  |
| `Trees/`           | Binary Tree, BST, traversals                  |
| `Graphs/`          | BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort          |
| `Searching/`       | Linear and Binary Search                      |
| `Sorting/`         | Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap sort               |
| `Recursion/`       | Recursive problems and patterns               |
| `DynamicProgramming/` | Memoization & Tabulation based solutions |
